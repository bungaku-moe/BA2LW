1. Open the program with debug to see the display on the left
2. Open the program and the interaction range is correct.
3. Because these files do not follow certain naming conventions.

   Take halo as an example, the general root bone is named Halo, Halo_Root, Halo_01

4. There are cases where the left and right eyes are named oppositely, such as Baizi
